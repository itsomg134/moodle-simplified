🔐 Assignment 1: OAuth-Based SSO Integration
Internship Role: PHP Developer Intern (Moodle Enhancement) Objective: Implement a secure, scalable Single Sign-On (SSO) system for Moodle using OAuth 2.0, enabling seamless authentication across platforms.

🧩 Project Architecture Overview
This assignment involves building two core components:

Moodle Authentication Plugin (PHP)

Integrates directly into Moodle’s modular authentication system

Handles login requests and redirects to the OAuth provider

Receives callback with authorization code and initiates token exchange

Bridge Service (Node.js or PHP)

Acts as a middleware between Moodle and the OAuth provider

Performs token exchange, user data retrieval, and session validation

Returns sanitized user profile data to Moodle for login completion

⚙️ Technical Workflow
plaintext
User → Moodle Login → Redirect to OAuth Provider → Bridge Service → Token Exchange → User Info → Moodle Session
Step-by-Step Flow:
User clicks “Login with OAuth” on Moodle login page.

Moodle plugin redirects to OAuth provider (e.g., Google, GitHub).

After user authentication, OAuth provider sends a callback to the bridge.

Bridge service exchanges the authorization code for an access token.

Bridge fetches user profile (name, email, etc.) and returns it to Moodle.

Moodle creates or updates the user session and logs the user in.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Component	Stack
Moodle Plugin	PHP, Moodle API
Bridge Service	Node.js (Express), JWT
OAuth Provider	Google/GitHub (OAuth 2.0)
Data Sync	JSON over HTTPS

📄 Deliverables
✅ Moodle plugin code with setup instructions

✅ Node.js bridge service with .env sample and dependency list

✅ README with:

Installation steps

Configuration guide

Testing instructions

✅ Optional demo video showing login flow

🔍 Security Considerations
Use HTTPS for all token exchanges

Sanitize and validate all user data before session creation

Store secrets (client ID, client secret) in .env files

Implement CSRF protection and token expiry handling

📈 Benefits of This Integration
Unified login experience across platforms

Reduced password fatigue and support overhead

Easier user provisioning and profile synchronization

Foundation for future integrations (e.g., Microsoft, LinkedIn)

🎨 Assignment 2: UI/UX Improvement Suggestions
Internship Role: PHP Developer Intern (Moodle Enhancement) Objective: Analyze the existing Moodle interface and propose actionable UI/UX improvements to enhance usability, engagement, and accessibility.

📊 Methodology
Conducted heuristic evaluation of Moodle’s core interface

Identified 6 key friction points affecting user experience

Proposed design solutions with wireframes and rationale

Prioritized improvements based on impact and implementation effort

🧭 Friction Points & Proposed Solutions
#	Issue	Priority	Proposed Solution
1	Cluttered Dashboard	High	Widget-based layout with personalized course cards, collapsible sections, and visual progress indicators
2	Inconsistent Navigation	High	Persistent top nav bar, standardized breadcrumbs, and consistent back-to-dashboard button
3	Mobile Unfriendly Interface	High	Mobile-first responsive design, larger touch targets, simplified workflows, and PWA support
4	Ineffective Notification System	Medium	Visible notification badge, categorized alerts, customizable preferences, and push/email options
5	Complex Assignment Submission	Medium	One-page drag-and-drop submission form with preview, confirmation receipt, and submission history
6	Outdated Visual Design	Low	Modern color palette, improved typography, consistent iconography, and optional dark mode
🖼️ Wireframes & Visuals
✅ Wireframes created for redesigned dashboard, mobile layout, and assignment submission flow

✅ Screenshots of current UI vs proposed alternatives

✅ Slide deck or PDF with annotations explaining each design choice

✅ Sample image:
